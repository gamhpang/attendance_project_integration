# attendance_project_integration

1. Objective:
  Integrate project and task selection into the employee attendance system, allowing users to specify the project, task, and description during check-in/check-out.

3. Changes Made:
Frontend Modifications:
    • View Template Extension:
        ◦ Extended the existing HrAttendanceMyMainMenu template to include two new dropdowns:
            ▪ Project Selection: A dropdown to select the project associated with the attendance.
            ▪ Task Selection: A dropdown dynamically populated with tasks based on the selected project.
        ◦ Added a text area for Description (either check-in or check-out), which is a required field.

JavaScript Logic:
    • Overridden the existing my_attendances.js to handle project selection dynamically.
    • Implemented event listeners to fetch tasks associated with the selected project.
    • Rendered tasks dynamically in the task dropdown based on the selected project.
    • Modified the update_attendance function to validate and submit selected values for the project, task, and description.
    
Backend Modifications:
    • New Fields in Models:
        ◦ Extended the hr.attendance model to include project_id, task_id, check_in_description, and check_out_description fields for storing project, task, and descriptions related to check-ins/check-outs.
    • Modifications to Attendance Logic:
        ◦ Overridden the attendance_manual method to record the project, task, and description during attendance updates.
        ◦ Logic ensures that the description is stored appropriately depending on whether the employee is checking in or out.
        
3. New Database Structures:
    • Added the following fields in the hr.attendance model:
        ◦ project_id: A Many2one field linking to the project.project model.
        ◦ task_id: A Many2one field linking to the project.task model.
        ◦ check_in_description: A Char field for storing the check-in description.
        ◦ check_out_description: A Char field for storing the check-out description.
